Clients calls the admin to request a task which will then assing a carer to the task.

The carer is notified of the task and can view the details in the app, including the client's name, location, and any special instructions.

Once the carer has completed the task, they mark it as done in the app, and the client is notified.

Admins can view the status of all tasks and make adjustments as needed, such as reassigning tasks or changing the schedule.
